<h2 class="ignoreLink" id="Background">Background</h2>

<p>This style-guide is reworked Google C++ Style Guide.</p>

<p>Note that this guide is not a C++ tutorial: we assume that
the reader is familiar with the language. </p>

 

<h2 id="Header_Files">Header Files</h2>

<p>In general, every <code>.cpp</code> file should have an
associated <code>.h</code> file. There are some common
exceptions, such as  unittests and
small <code>.cpp</code> files containing just a
<code>main()</code> function.</p>

<p>Correct use of header files can make a huge difference to
the readability, size and performance of your code.</p>

<p>The following rules will guide you through the various
pitfalls of using header files.</p>

<h3 id="Definition_and_Declaration">Definition and Declaration</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>
  Header files should end in <code>.h</code>.
  Separate <code>-inl.h</code> headers are used for implementation of template code.
</p>
</div> 

<div class="stylebody">
<p>
  Header files should contain declarations only. All definitions and implementation
  should be placed into <code>.cpp</code> or <code>-inl.h</code> file.
  However small header-only definitions are allowed if creating associated
  <code>.cpp</code> or <code>-inl.h</code> file can hamper readability.
</p>
<p>
  If a template or inline function is declared in a <code>.h</code> file,
  define it separate <code>-inl.h</code> file.
</p>

<p>As an exception, a function template that is explicitly
instantiated for all relevant sets of template arguments, or
that is a private member of a class, may
be defined in the only <code>.cpp</code> file that
instantiates the template.</p>

</div> 

<h3 id="_pragma_once_Directive">#pragma once Directive</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>All header files should contain <code>#pragma once</code> directive to
prevent multiple inclusion.</p>
</div> 

<div class="stylebody">

<p>Include guards are deprecated as a bad technique.
  <code>#pragma once</code> requires less code and no special naming convention.
</p>

<pre class="badcode">
// Bad practice:
#ifndef FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_
#define FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_
...
#endif  // FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_
</pre>

<pre>
// OK:
#pragma once
</pre>

</div> 

<h3 id="Forward_Declarations">Forward Declarations</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>You may forward declare ordinary classes in order to avoid
unnecessary <code>#include</code>s.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>A "forward declaration" is a declaration of a class,
function, or template without an associated definition.
<code>#include</code> lines can often be replaced with
forward declarations of whatever symbols are actually
used by the client code.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<ul>
  <li>Unnecessary <code>#include</code>s force the
  compiler to open more files and process more
  input.</li>

  <li>They can also force your code to be recompiled more
  often, due to changes in the header.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<ul>
  <li>It can be difficult to determine the correct form
  of a forward declaration in the presence of features
  like templates, typedefs, default parameters, and using
  declarations.</li>

  <li>It can be difficult to determine whether a forward
  declaration or a full <code>#include</code> is needed
  for a given piece of code, particularly when implicit
  conversion operations are involved. In extreme cases,
  replacing an <code>#include</code> with a forward
  declaration can silently change the meaning of
  code.</li>

  <li>Forward declaring multiple symbols from a header
  can be more verbose than simply
  <code>#include</code>ing the header.</li>

  <li>Forward declarations of functions and templates can
  prevent the header owners from making
  otherwise-compatible changes to their APIs; for
  example, widening a parameter type, or adding a
  template parameter with a default value.</li>
  <li>Forward declaring symbols from namespace
  <code>std::</code> usually yields undefined
  behavior.</li>

  <li>Structuring code to enable forward declarations
  (e.g. using pointer members instead of object members)
  can make the code slower and more complex.</li>

  <li>The practical efficiency benefits of forward
  declarations are unproven.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<ul>
  <li>When using a function declared in a header file,
  always <code>#include</code> that header.</li>

  <li>When using a class template, prefer to
  <code>#include</code> its header file.</li>

  <li>When using an ordinary class, relying on a forward
  declaration is OK, but be wary of situations where a
  forward declaration may be insufficient or incorrect;
  when in doubt, just <code>#include</code> the
  appropriate header.</li>

  <li>Do not replace data members with pointers just to
  avoid an <code>#include</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see <a href="#Names_and_Order_of_Includes">Names and Order
of Includes</a> for rules about when to #include a header.</p>
</div>

</div> 

<h3 id="Inline_Functions">Inline Functions</h3>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>You don't usually have to define functions inlined. It turns out that compiler
  can ignore an <code>inline</code> statement or, otherwise, inline function
  without one.
</p>
<p>
  Don't try to trick the compiler, write your code without excess
  statements you cannot control.
</p>

</div> 

<h3 id="Function_Parameter_Ordering">Function Parameter Ordering</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>When defining a function, parameter order is: inputs, then
outputs.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">
<p>Parameters to C/C++ functions are either input to the
function, output from the function, or both. Input
parameters are usually values or <code>const</code>
references, while output and input/output parameters will
be non-<code>const</code> references. When ordering
function parameters, put all input-only parameters before
any output parameters. In particular, do not add new
parameters to the end of the function just because they
are new; place new input-only parameters before the
output parameters.</p>

<p>This is not a hard-and-fast rule. Parameters that are
both input and output (often classes/structs) muddy the
waters, and, as always, consistency with related
functions may require you to bend the rule.</p>

</div> 

<h3 id="Names_and_Order_of_Includes">Names and Order of Includes</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Use standard order for readability and to avoid hidden
dependencies: Related header, any other libraries'
<code>.h</code>, your project's <code>.h</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">
<p>
All of a project's header files should be
listed as descendants of the project's source
directory without use of UNIX directory shortcuts
<code>.</code> (the current directory) or <code>..</code>
(the parent directory). For example,

<code>your-awesome-project/src/base/logging.h</code>
should be included as:</p>

<pre>#include "base/logging.h"
</pre>

<p class="exception">Files placed into the same directory may include each other
  without explicit path indication, if they supposed to have deep inseparable relation.
  For example, <code>foo.cpp</code> may include its header as <code>#include "foo.h"</code>.
</p>

<p>In <code><var>dir/foo</var>.cpp</code> or
<code><var>dir/foo_test</var>.cpp</code>, whose main
purpose is to implement or test the stuff in
<code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code>, order your includes
as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code>.</li>

  <li>C system files., C++ system files., Other libraries' <code>.h</code> files.</li>

  <li>
  Your project's <code>.h</code> files.</li>
</ol>

<p>With the preferred ordering, if
<code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code> omits any necessary
includes, the build of <code><var>dir/foo</var>.cpp</code>
or <code><var>dir/foo</var>_test.cpp</code> will break.
Thus, this rule ensures that build breaks show up first
for the people working on these files, not for innocent
people in other packages.</p>

<p><code><var>dir/foo</var>.cpp</code> and
<code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code> are usually in the same
directory (e.g. <code>base/basictypes_test.cpp</code> and
<code>base/basictypes.h</code>), but may sometimes be in different
directories too.</p>



<p>Within each section the includes should be ordered
alphabetically. Note that older code might not conform to
this rule and should be fixed when convenient.</p>

<p>You should include all the headers that define the symbols you rely
upon (except in cases of <a href="#Forward_Declarations">forward
declaration</a>). If you rely on symbols from <code>bar.h</code>,
don't count on the fact that you included <code>foo.h</code> which
(currently) includes <code>bar.h</code>: include <code>bar.h</code>
yourself, unless <code>foo.h</code> explicitly demonstrates its intent
to provide you the symbols of <code>bar.h</code>.  However, any
includes present in the related header do not need to be included
again in the related <code>cpp</code> (i.e., <code>foo.cpp</code> can
rely on <code>foo.h</code>'s includes).</p>

<p>For example, the includes in

<code>your-awesome-project/src/foo/internal/fooserver.cpp</code>
might look like this:</p>


<pre>#include "fooserver.h"

#include &lt;hash_map&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

#include "base/basictypes.h"
#include "base/commandlineflags.h"
#include "foo/server/bar.h"
</pre>

<p class="exception">Sometimes, system-specific code needs
conditional includes. Such code can put conditional
includes after other includes. Of course, keep your
system-specific code small and localized. Example:</p>

<pre>#include "fooserver.h"

#include "base/port.h"  // For LANG_CXX11.

#ifdef LANG_CXX11
#include &lt;initializer_list&gt;
#endif  // LANG_CXX11
</pre>

</div> 

<h2 id="Scoping">Scoping</h2>

<h3 id="Namespaces">Namespaces</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Unnamed namespaces in <code>.cpp</code> files are
encouraged. With named namespaces, choose the name based on
the 
project, and possibly its
path. Do not use a <i>using-directive</i>.
Do not use inline namespaces.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>Namespaces subdivide the global scope
into distinct, named scopes, and so are useful for preventing
name collisions in the global scope.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">

<p>Namespaces provide a (hierarchical) axis of naming, in
addition to the (also hierarchical) name axis provided by
classes.</p>

<p>For example, if two different projects have a class
<code>Foo</code> in the global scope, these symbols may
collide at compile time or at runtime. If each project
places their code in a namespace,
<code>project1::Foo</code> and <code>project2::Foo</code>
are now distinct symbols that do not collide.</p>

<p>Inline namespaces automatically place their names in
the enclosing scope. Consider the following snippet, for
example:</p>

<pre>namespace X {
inline namespace Y {
  void foo();
}
}
</pre>

<p>The expressions <code>X::Y::foo()</code> and
<code>X::foo()</code> are interchangeable. Inline
namespaces are primarily intended for ABI compatibility
across versions.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">

<p>Namespaces can be confusing, because they provide an
additional (hierarchical) axis of naming, in addition to
the (also hierarchical) name axis provided by
classes.</p>

<p>Inline namespaces, in particular, can be confusing
because names aren't actually restricted to the namespace
where they are declared. They are only useful as part of
some larger versioning policy.</p>

<p>Use of unnamed namespaces in header files can easily
cause violations of the C++ One Definition Rule
(ODR).</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">

<p>Use namespaces according to the policy described
below. Terminate namespaces with comments as shown in the
given examples.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Unnamed Namespaces</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Unnamed namespaces are allowed and even encouraged
  in <code>.cpp</code> files, to avoid link time naming
  conflicts:</p>

<pre>namespace {                           // This is in a .cpp file.

// The content of a namespace is not indented.
//
// This function is guaranteed not to generate a colliding symbol
// with other symbols at link time, and is only visible to
// callers in this .cpp file.
bool UpdateInternals(Frobber* f, int newval)
{
    ...
}

} // anonymous namespace
</pre>

  <p>However, file-scope declarations that are
  associated with a particular class may be declared in
  that class as types, static data members or static
  member functions rather than as members of an unnamed
  namespace.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Do not use unnamed namespaces in <code>.h</code>
  files.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Named Namespaces</h4>

<p>Named namespaces should be used as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Namespaces wrap the entire source file after includes and
  forward declarations of classes from other namespaces:</p>

<pre>// In the .h file
namespace mynamespace
{

// All declarations are within the namespace scope.
// Notice the lack of indentation.
class MyClass
{
public:
    ...
    void Foo();
};

} // namespace mynamespace
</pre>

<pre>// In the .cpp file
namespace mynamespace
{

// Definition of functions is within scope of the namespace.
void MyClass::Foo()
{
    ...
}

} // namespace mynamespace
</pre>

  <p>The typical <code>.cpp</code> file might have more
  complex detail, including the need to reference
  classes in other namespaces.</p>


<pre>#include "a.h"

DEFINE_bool(someflag, false, "dummy flag");

class C;  // Forward declaration of class C in the global namespace.
namespace a {
    class A;
} // Forward declaration of a::A.

namespace b
{
    ...code for b...         // Code goes against the left margin.
} // namespace b
</pre>
  </li>

  

  <li>Do not declare anything in namespace
  <code>std</code>, not even forward declarations of
  standard library classes. Declaring entities in
  namespace <code>std</code> is undefined behavior, i.e.,
  not portable. To declare entities from the standard
  library, include the appropriate header file.</li>

  <li><p>You may not use a <i>using-directive</i>
  to make all names from a namespace available.</p>

<pre class="badcode">// Forbidden -- This pollutes the namespace.
using namespace foo;
</pre>
  </li>

  <li><p>You may use a <i>using-declaration</i>
  anywhere in a <code>.cpp</code> file, and in functions,
  methods or classes in <code>.h</code> files.</p>

<pre>// OK in .cpp files.
// Must be in a function, method or class in .h files.
using ::foo::bar;
</pre>
  </li>

  <li><p>Namespace aliases are allowed anywhere in a <code>
  .cpp</code> file, anywhere inside the named namespace
  that wraps an entire <code>.h</code> file, and in
  functions and methods.</p>

<pre>// Shorten access to some commonly used names in .cpp files.
namespace fbz = ::foo::bar::baz;

// Shorten access to some commonly used names (in a .h file).
namespace librarian {
// The following alias is available to all files including
// this header (in namespace librarian):
// alias names should therefore be chosen consistently
// within a project.
namespace pd_s = ::pipeline_diagnostics::sidetable;

void my_function()
{
    // namespace alias local to a function (or method).
    namespace fbz = ::foo::bar::baz;
    ...
}
} // namespace librarian
</pre>

  <p>Note that an alias in a .h file is visible to
  everyone #including that file, so public headers
  (those available outside a project) and headers
  transitively #included by them, should avoid defining
  aliases, as part of the general goal of keeping
  public APIs as small as possible.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Do not use inline namespaces.</li>
</ul>
 

 
</div> 

<h3 id="Nested_Classes">Nested Classes</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Although you may use public nested classes when they are
part of an interface, consider a <a href="#Namespaces">namespace</a>
to keep declarations out of the global scope.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>A class can define another class within it; this is also
called a <i>member class</i>.</p>


<pre>class Foo
{
private:
    // Bar is a member class, nested within Foo.
    class Bar
    {
        ...
    };
};
</pre>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>This is useful when the nested (or member) class is only
used by the enclosing class; making it a member puts it
in the enclosing class scope rather than polluting the
outer scope with the class name. Nested classes can be
forward declared within the enclosing class and then
defined in the <code>.cpp</code> file to avoid including
the nested class definition in the enclosing class
declaration, since the nested class definition is usually
only relevant to the implementation.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>Nested classes can be forward-declared only within the
definition of the enclosing class. Thus, any header file
manipulating a <code>Foo::Bar*</code> pointer will have
to include the full class declaration for
<code>Foo</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>Do not make nested classes public unless they are
actually part of the interface, e.g., a class that holds a
set of options for some method. </p>
</div>

</div> 

<h3 id="Nonmember,_Static_Member,_and_Global_Functions">Nonmember, Static Member, and Global Functions</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Prefer nonmember functions within a namespace or static
member functions to global functions; use completely global
functions rarely.</p>
</div>

 <div class="stylebody">

 <div class="pros">
 <p>Nonmember and static member functions can be useful in
 some situations. Putting nonmember functions in a
 namespace avoids polluting the global namespace.</p>
 </div>

<div class="cons">
<p>Nonmember and static member functions may make more sense
as members of a new class, especially if they access
external resources or have significant dependencies.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>Sometimes it is useful, or even necessary, to define a
function not bound to a class instance. Such a function
can be either a static member or a nonmember function.
Nonmember functions should not depend on external
variables, and should nearly always exist in a namespace.
Rather than creating classes only to group static member
functions which do not share static data, use
<a href="#Namespaces">namespaces</a> instead.</p>

<p>Functions defined in the same compilation unit as
production classes may introduce unnecessary coupling and
link-time dependencies when directly called from other
compilation units; static member functions are
particularly susceptible to this. Consider extracting a
new class, or placing the functions in a namespace
possibly in a separate library.</p>

<p>If you must define a nonmember function and it is only
needed in its <code>.cpp</code> file, use an unnamed
<a href="#Namespaces">namespace</a> or
<code>static</code> linkage (eg <code>static int Foo()
{...}</code>) to limit its scope.</p>
</div>

</div> 

<h3 id="Local_Variables">Local Variables</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Place a function's variables in the narrowest scope
possible, and initialize variables in the declaration.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>C++ allows you to declare variables anywhere in a
function. We encourage you to declare them in as local a
scope as possible, and as close to the first use as
possible. This makes it easier for the reader to find the
declaration and see what type the variable is and what it
was initialized to. In particular, initialization should
be used instead of declaration and assignment, e.g.:</p>

<pre class="badcode">int i;
i = f();      // Bad -- initialization separate from declaration.
</pre>

<pre>int j = g();  // Good -- declaration has initialization.
</pre>

<pre class="badcode">vector&lt;int&gt; v;
v.push_back(1);  // Prefer initializing using brace initialization.
v.push_back(2);
</pre>

<pre>vector&lt;int&gt; v = {1, 2};  // Good -- v starts initialized.
</pre>

<p>Variables needed for <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>
and <code>for</code> statements should normally be declared
within those statements, so that such variables are confined
to those scopes.  E.g.:</p>

<pre>while (const char* p = strchr(str, '/'))
    str = p + 1;
</pre>

<p>There is one caveat: if the variable is an object, its
constructor is invoked every time it enters scope and is
created, and its destructor is invoked every time it goes
out of scope.</p>

<pre class="badcode">// Inefficient implementation:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i)
{
    Foo f;  // My ctor and dtor get called 1000000 times each.
    f.DoSomething(i);
}
</pre>

<p>It may be more efficient to declare such a variable
used in a loop outside that loop:</p>

<pre>Foo f;  // My ctor and dtor get called once each.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i)
{
    f.DoSomething(i);
}
</pre>

</div> 


<h2 id="Classes">Classes</h2>

<p>Classes are the fundamental unit of code in C++. Naturally,
we use them extensively. This section lists the main dos and
don'ts you should follow when writing a class.</p>

<h3 id="Initialization">Initialization</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>If your class defines member variables, you must provide an
in-class initializer for every member variable or write a
constructor (which can be a default constructor). If you do
not declare any constructors yourself then the compiler
will generate a default constructor for you, which may
leave some fields uninitialized or initialized to
inappropriate values.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>The default constructor is called when we
<code>new</code> a class object with no arguments. It is always
called when calling <code>new[]</code> (for arrays). In-class
member initialization means declaring a member variable using a
construction like <code>int count_ = 17;</code> or
<code>string name_{"abc"};</code>, as opposed to just
<code>int count_;</code> or <code>string name_;</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>A user-defined default constructor is used to
initialize an object if no initializer is provided. It
can ensure that an object is always in a valid and usable
state as soon as it's constructed; it can also ensure
that an object is initially created in an obviously
"impossible" state, to aid debugging.</p>

<p>In-class member initialization ensures that a member
variable will be initialized appropriately without having
to duplicate the initialization code in multiple
constructors. This can reduce bugs where you add a new
member variable, initialize it in one constructor, and
forget to put that initialization code in another
constructor.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>Explicitly defining a default constructor is extra
work for you, the code writer.</p>

<p>In-class member initialization is potentially
confusing if a member variable is initialized as part of
its declaration and also initialized in a constructor,
since the value in the constructor will override the
value in the declaration.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>Use in-class member initialization for simple
initializations, especially when a member variable must
be initialized the same way in more than one
constructor.</p>

<p>If your class defines member variables that aren't
initialized in-class, and if it has no other
constructors, you must define a default constructor (one
that takes no arguments). It should preferably initialize
the object in such a way that its internal state is
consistent and valid.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that if you have no other
constructors and do not define a default constructor, the
compiler will generate one for you. This compiler
generated constructor may not initialize your object
sensibly.</p>

<p>If your class inherits from an existing class but you
add no new member variables, you are not required to have
a default constructor. </p>
</div>

</div> 

<h3 id="Explicit_Constructors">Explicit Constructors</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Use the C++ keyword <code>explicit</code> for constructors
callable with one argument.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p> Normally, if a
constructor can be called with one argument, it can be used as a
conversion. For instance, if you define
<code>Foo::Foo(string name)</code> and then pass a string
to a function that expects a <code>Foo</code>, the
constructor will be called to convert the string into a
<code>Foo</code> and will pass the <code>Foo</code> to
your function for you. This can be convenient but is also
a source of trouble when things get converted and new
objects created without you meaning them to. Declaring a
constructor <code>explicit</code> prevents it from being
invoked implicitly as a conversion.</p>
<p>In addition to single-parameter constructors, this also
applies to constructors where every parameter after the
first has a default value, e.g.,
<code>Foo::Foo(string name, int id = 42)</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>Avoids undesirable conversions.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>None.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">

<p>We require all constructors that are callable with
a single argument to be
explicit. Always put <code>explicit</code> in front of
such constructors in the class definition:
<code>explicit Foo(string name);</code></p>

<p>Copy and move constructors are exceptions: they should not be
<code>explicit</code>.  Classes that are intended to be transparent
wrappers around other classes are also exceptions.
</p>

<p>Finally, constructors that take only a
<code>std::initializer_list</code> may be non-explicit. This permits
construction of your type from a <a href="#Braced_Initializer_List">braced initializer list</a>, as in an assignment-style initialization,
function argument, or return statement. For example:</p>
<pre>  MyType m = {1, 2};
  MyType MakeMyType() { return {1, 2}; }
  TakeMyType({1, 2});
</pre>
</div>

</div> 

<h3 id="Copyable_Movable_Types">Copyable and Movable Types</h3>
<a id="Copy_Constructors"></a>
<div class="summary">
<p>Support copying and/or moving if it makes sense for your type.
Otherwise, disable the implicitly generated special
functions that perform copies and moves.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>A copyable type allows its objects to be initialized or assigned
from any other object of the same type, without changing the value of the source.
For user-defined types, the copy behavior is defined by the copy
constructor and the copy-assignment operator.
<code>string</code> is an example of a copyable type.</p>

<p>A movable type is one that can be initialized and assigned
from temporaries (all copyable types are therefore movable).
<code>std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;</code> is an example of a movable but not
copyable type. For user-defined types, the move behavior is defined by the move
constructor and the move-assignment operator.</p>

<p>The copy/move constructors can be implicitly invoked by the compiler
in some situations, e.g. when passing objects by value.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>Objects of copyable and movable types can be passed and returned
by value, which makes APIs simpler, safer, and more general.
Unlike when passing pointers or references, there's no risk of
confusion over ownership, lifetime, mutability, and similar
issues, and no need to specify them in the contract. It also
prevents non-local interactions between the client and the
implementation, which makes them easier to understand and
maintain. Such objects can be used with generic
APIs that require pass-by-value, such as most containers.</p>

<p>Copy/move constructors and assignment operators are usually
easier to define correctly than alternatives
like <code>Clone()</code>, <code>CopyFrom()</code> or <code>Swap()</code>,
because they can be generated by the compiler, either implicitly or
with <code>= default</code>.  They are concise, and ensure
that all data members are copied. Copy and move
constructors are also generally more efficient, because they don't
require heap allocation or separate initialization and assignment
steps, and they're eligible for optimizations such as

<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision">
copy elision</a>.</p>

<p>Move operations allow the implicit and efficient transfer of
resources out of rvalue objects. This allows a plainer coding style
in some cases.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>Many types do not need to be copyable, and providing copy
operations for them can be confusing, nonsensical, or outright
incorrect. Copy/assigment operations for base class types are
hazardous, because use of them can lead to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_slicing">object
slicing</a>. Defaulted or carelessly-implemented copy operations
can be incorrect, and the resulting bugs can be confusing and
difficult to diagnose.</p>

<p>Copy constructors are invoked implicitly, which makes the
invocation easy to miss. This may cause confusion, particularly
for programmers used to languages where pass-by-reference is
conventional or mandatory. It may also encourage excessive
copying, which can cause performance problems.</p>


</div>

<div class="decision">

<p>Make your type copyable/movable if it will be useful, and if it
makes sense in the context of the rest of the API.
As a rule of thumb, if the behavior (including computational
complexity) of a copy isn't immediately obvious to users of your type,
your type shouldn't be copyable.  If you choose to make it copyable,
define both copy operations (constructor and assignment).  If your
type is copyable and a move operation is more efficient than a copy,
define both move operations (constructor and assignment).
If your type is not copyable, but the correctness of a move is obvious
to users of the type and its fields support it, you may make the type
move-only by defining both of the move operations.
</p>

<p>Prefer to define copy and move operations with <code>= default</code>.
Defining non-default move operations currently requires a style
exception. Remember to review the correctness of any defaulted
operations as you would any other code.
</p>

<p>Due to the risk of slicing, avoid providing an assignment
operator or public copy/move constructor for a class that's
intended to be derived from (and avoid deriving from a class
with such members). If your base class needs to be
copyable, provide a public virtual <code>Clone()</code>
method, and a protected copy constructor that derived classes
can use to implement it.</p>

<p>If you do not want to support copy/move operations on
your type, explicitly disable them using <code>= delete</code> or
whatever
other mechanism your project uses.

<div class="summary">
<p> Use delegating and inheriting
constructors when they reduce code duplication.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">

<p>Delegating and inheriting constructors are two
different features, both introduced in C++11, for
reducing code duplication in constructors. Delegating
constructors allow one of a class's constructors to
forward work to one of the class's other constructors,
using a special variant of the initialization list
syntax. For example:</p>

<pre>
X::X(const string&amp; name)
    : name_(name)
{
    ...
}

X::X()
    : X("")
{}
</pre>

<p>Inheriting constructors allow a derived class to have
its base class's constructors available directly, just as
with any of the base class's other member functions,
instead of having to redeclare them. This is especially
useful if the base has multiple constructors. For
example:</p>

<pre>class Base
{
public:
    Base();
    Base(int n);
    Base(const string&amp; s);
    ...
};

class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    using Base::Base;  // Base's constructors are redeclared here.
};
</pre>

<p>This is especially useful when <code>Derived</code>'s
constructors don't have to do anything more than calling
<code>Base</code>'s constructors.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>Delegating and inheriting constructors reduce
verbosity and boilerplate, which can improve
readability.</p>

<p>Delegating constructors are familiar to Java
programmers.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>It's possible to approximate the behavior of
delegating constructors by using a helper function.</p>

<p>Inheriting constructors may be confusing if a derived
class introduces new member variables, since the base
class constructor doesn't know about them.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>Use delegating and inheriting constructors when they reduce
boilerplate and improve readability.
Be cautious about inheriting constructors when your derived class has
new member variables. Inheriting constructors may still be appropriate
in that case if you can use in-class member initialization
for the derived class's member variables.</p>

<p>Use a <code>struct</code> only for passive objects that

</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>The <code>struct</code> and <code>class</code>
keywords behave almost identically in C++. We add our own
semantic meanings to each keyword, so you should use the
appropriate keyword for the data-type you're
defining.</p>

<p><code>structs</code> should be used for passive
objects that carry data, and may have associated
constants, but lack any functionality other than
access/setting the data members. The accessing/setting of
fields is done by directly accessing the fields rather
than through method invocations. Methods should not
provide behavior but should only be used to set up the
data members, e.g., constructor, destructor,
<code>Initialize()</code>, <code>Reset()</code>,
<code>Validate()</code>.</p>

<p>If more functionality is required, a
<code>class</code> is more appropriate. If in doubt, make
it a <code>class</code>.</p>

<p>For consistency with STL, you can use

<h3 id="Inheritance">Inheritance</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Composition is often more appropriate than inheritance.

<div class="stylebody">

<p>Do not overuse implementation inheritance. Composition

<p>Make your destructor <code>virtual</code> if
necessary. If your class has virtual methods, its
destructor should be virtual.</p>

<p>Limit the use of <code>protected</code> to those
member functions that might need to be accessed from
subclasses. Note that <a href="#Access_Control">data

<p>Explicitly annotate overrides of virtual functions
or virtual destructors with an <code>override</code>
or (less frequently) <code>final</code> specifier.
Older (pre-C++11) code will use the
<code>virtual</code> keyword as an inferior
alternative annotation. For clarity, use exactly one of
<code>override</code>, <code>final</code>, or
<code>virtual</code> when declaring an override.
Rationale: A function or destructor marked
<code>override</code> or <code>final</code> that is
not an override of a base class virtual function will
not compile, and this helps catch common errors. The
specifiers serve as documentation; if no specifier is
present, the reader has to check all ancestors of the
class in question to determine if the function or
destructor is virtual or not.</p>

<h3 id="Operator_Overloading">Operator Overloading</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p> Do not overload operators except in rare, special

</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p> A class can
define that operators such as <code>+</code> and
<code>/</code> operate on the class as if it were a
built-in type. An overload of <code>operator""</code>
allows the built-in literal syntax to be used to create
objects of class types.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>Operator overloading can make code appear more
intuitive because a class will behave in the same way as
built-in types (such as <code>int</code>). Overloaded
operators are more playful names for functions that are
less-colorfully named, such as <code>Equals()</code> or
<code>Add()</code>.</p>

<p>For some template functions to work correctly, you may
need to define operators.</p>

<p>User-defined literals are a very concise notation for
creating objects of user-defined types.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>While operator overloading can make code more intuitive,
it has several drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It can fool our intuition into thinking that
  expensive operations are cheap, built-in
  operations.</li>

  <li>It is much harder to find the call sites for
  overloaded operators. Searching for
  <code>Equals()</code> is much easier than searching for
  relevant invocations of <code>==</code>.</li>

  <li>Some operators work on pointers too, making it easy
  to introduce bugs. <code>Foo + 4</code> may do one
  thing, while <code>&amp;Foo + 4</code> does something
  totally different. The compiler does not complain for
  either of these, making this very hard to debug.</li>

  <li>User-defined literals allow creating new syntactic
  forms that are unfamiliar even to experienced C++
  programmers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overloading also has surprising ramifications. For
instance, if a class overloads unary
<code>operator&amp;</code>, it cannot safely be
forward-declared.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>In general, do not overload operators. You can define
ordinary functions like <code>Equals()</code> if
you need them. Likewise, avoid the dangerous unary
<code>operator&amp;</code> at all costs, if there's any
possibility the class might be forward-declared.</p>

<p>Do not overload <code>operator""</code>, i.e. do not
introduce user-defined literals.</p>

<p>However, there may be rare cases where you need to
overload an operator to interoperate with templates or
"standard" C++ classes (such as
<code>operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp;, const T&amp;)</code>
for logging). These are acceptable if fully justified, but you should try to avoid these
whenever possible. In particular, do not overload
<code>operator==</code> or <code>operator&lt;</code> just
so that your class can be used as a key in an STL
container; instead, you should create equality and
comparison functor types when declaring the
container.</p>

<p>Some of the STL algorithms do require you to overload
<code>operator==</code>, and you may do so in these
cases, provided you document why.</p>

<p>Prefer to have single, fixed owners for dynamically

</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>"Ownership" is a bookkeeping technique for managing
dynamically allocated memory (and other resources). The
owner of a dynamically allocated object is an object or
function that is responsible for ensuring that it is
deleted when no longer needed. Ownership can sometimes be
shared, in which case the last owner is typically
responsible for deleting it. Even when ownership is not
shared, it can be transferred from one piece of code to
another.</p>

<p>"Smart" pointers are classes that act like pointers,
e.g. by overloading the <code>*</code> and
<code>-&gt;</code> operators. Some smart pointer types
can be used to automate ownership bookkeeping, to ensure
these responsibilities are met.
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr">
<code>std::unique_ptr</code></a> is a smart pointer type
introduced in C++11, which expresses exclusive ownership
of a dynamically allocated object; the object is deleted
when the <code>std::unique_ptr</code> goes out of scope.
It cannot be copied, but can be <em>moved</em> to
represent ownership transfer.
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr">
<code>std::shared_ptr</code></a> is a smart pointer type
that expresses shared ownership of
a dynamically allocated object. <code>std::shared_ptr</code>s
can be copied; ownership of the object is shared among
all copies, and the object is deleted when the last
<code>std::shared_ptr</code> is destroyed. </p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<ul>
  <li>It's virtually impossible to manage dynamically
  allocated memory without some sort of ownership
  logic.</li>

  <li>Transferring ownership of an object can be cheaper
  than copying it (if copying it is even possible).</li>

  <li>Transferring ownership can be simpler than
  'borrowing' a pointer or reference, because it reduces
  the need to coordinate the lifetime of the object
  between the two users.</li>

  <li>Smart pointers can improve readability by making
  ownership logic explicit, self-documenting, and
  unambiguous.</li>

  <li>Smart pointers can eliminate manual ownership
  bookkeeping, simplifying the code and ruling out large
  classes of errors.</li>

  <li>For const objects, shared ownership can be a simple
  and efficient alternative to deep copying.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<ul>
  <li>Ownership must be represented and transferred via
  pointers (whether smart or plain). Pointer semantics
  are more complicated than value semantics, especially
  in APIs: you have to worry not just about ownership,
  but also aliasing, lifetime, and mutability, among
  other issues.</li>

  <li>The performance costs of value semantics are often
  overestimated, so the performance benefits of ownership
  transfer might not justify the readability and
  complexity costs.</li>

  <li>APIs that transfer ownership force their clients
  into a single memory management model.</li>

  <li>Code using smart pointers is less explicit about
  where the resource releases take place.</li>

  <li><code>std::unique_ptr</code> expresses ownership
  transfer using C++11's move semantics, which are
  relatively new and may confuse some programmers.</li>

  <li>Shared ownership can be a tempting alternative to
  careful ownership design, obfuscating the design of a
  system.</li>

  <li>Shared ownership requires explicit bookkeeping at
  run-time, which can be costly.</li>

  <li>In some cases (e.g. cyclic references), objects
  with shared ownership may never be deleted.</li>

  <li>Smart pointers are not perfect substitutes for
  plain pointers.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>If dynamic allocation is necessary, prefer to keep
ownership with the code that allocated it. If other code
needs access to the object, consider passing it a copy,
or passing a pointer or reference without transferring
ownership. Prefer to use <code>std::unique_ptr</code> to
make ownership transfer explicit. For example:</p>

<pre>std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; FooFactory();
void FooConsumer(std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; ptr);

<p>Do not design your code to use shared ownership
without a very good reason. One such reason is to avoid
expensive copy operations, but you should only do this if
the performance benefits are significant, and the
underlying object is immutable (i.e.

do use shared ownership, prefer to use

</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>Querying the type of an object at run-time frequently
means a design problem. Needing to know the type of an
object at runtime is often an indication that the design
of your class hierarchy is flawed.</p>

<p>Undisciplined use of RTTI makes code hard to maintain.
It can lead to type-based decision trees or switch
statements scattered throughout the code, all of which
must be examined when making further changes.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>The standard alternatives to RTTI (described below)
require modification or redesign of the class hierarchy
in question. Sometimes such modifications are infeasible
or undesirable, particularly in widely-used or mature
code.</p>

<p>RTTI can be useful in some unit tests. For example, it
is useful in tests of factory classes where the test has
to verify that a newly created object has the expected
dynamic type. It is also useful in managing the
relationship between objects and their mocks.</p>

<p>RTTI is useful when considering multiple abstract
objects. Consider</p>

<pre>bool Base::Equal(Base* other) = 0;
bool Derived::Equal(Base* other)
{
    Derived* that = dynamic_cast&lt;Derived*&gt;(other);
    if (that == nullptr)
        return false;
    ...
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>RTTI has legitimate uses but is prone to abuse, so you
must be careful when using it. You may use it freely in
unittests, but avoid it when possible in other code. In
particular, think twice before using RTTI in new code. If
you find yourself needing to write code that behaves
differently based on the class of an object, consider one
of the following alternatives to querying the type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Virtual methods are the preferred way of executing
  different code paths depending on a specific subclass
  type. This puts the work within the object itself.</li>

  <li>If the work belongs outside the object and instead
  in some processing code, consider a double-dispatch
  solution, such as the Visitor design pattern. This
  allows a facility outside the object itself to
  determine the type of class using the built-in type
  system.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the logic of a program guarantees that a given
instance of a base class is in fact an instance of a
particular derived class, then a
<code>dynamic_cast</code> may be used freely on the
object.  Usually one
can use a <code>static_cast</code> as an alternative in
such situations.</p>

<p>Decision trees based on type are a strong indication
that your code is on the wrong track.</p>

<pre class="badcode">if (typeid(*data) == typeid(D1)) {
  ...
} else if (typeid(*data) == typeid(D2)) {
  ...
} else if (typeid(*data) == typeid(D3)) {
...
</pre>

<p>Code such as this usually breaks when additional
subclasses are added to the class hierarchy. Moreover,
when properties of a subclass change, it is difficult to
find and modify all the affected code segments.</p>

<p>Do not hand-implement an RTTI-like workaround. The
arguments against RTTI apply just as much to workarounds
like class hierarchies with type tags. Moreover,
workarounds disguise your true intent.</p>

<div class="pros">
<p>When the return value is ignored, the "pre" form
(<code>++i</code>) is never less efficient than the
"post" form (<code>i++</code>), and is often more
efficient. This is because post-increment (or decrement)
requires a copy of <code>i</code> to be made, which is
the value of the expression. If <code>i</code> is an
iterator or other non-scalar type, copying <code>i</code>
could be expensive. Since the two types of increment
behave the same when the value is ignored, why not just
always pre-increment?</p>

<div class="cons">
<p>The tradition developed, in C, of using post-increment

<h4>Where to put the const</h4>

<p>Some people favor the form <code>int const *foo</code>

rule that <code>const</code> always follows the object
it's describing. However, this consistency argument
doesn't apply in codebases with few deeply-nested pointer
expressions since most <code>const</code> expressions
have only one <code>const</code>, and it applies to the
underlying value. In such cases, there's no consistency
to maintain. Putting the <code>const</code> first is
arguably more readable, since it follows English in
putting the "adjective" (<code>const</code>) before the

performance-critical code, use an inline function.
Instead of using a macro to store a constant, use a
<code>const</code> variable. Instead of using a macro to
"abbreviate" a long variable name, use a reference.
Instead of using a macro to conditionally compile code
... well, don't do that at all (except, of course, for
the <code>#define</code> guards to prevent double
inclusion of header files). It makes testing much more
difficult.</p>

<p>Macros can do things these other techniques cannot,
and you do see them in the codebase, especially in the
lower-level libraries. And some of their special features
(like stringifying, concatenation, and so forth) are not
available through the language proper. But before using a
macro, consider carefully whether there's a non-macro way
to achieve the same result.</p>

<p>The following usage pattern will avoid many problems
with macros; if you use macros, follow it whenever
possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don't define macros in a <code>.h</code> file.</li>

  <li><code>#define</code> macros right before you use
  them, and <code>#undef</code> them right after.</li>

  <li>Do not just <code>#undef</code> an existing macro

  that's likely to be unique.</li>

  <li>Try not to use macros that expand to unbalanced C++

<p>In C++11, this syntax was generalized, and any object type can now

created from <i>braced-init-list</i>:</p>

<pre>class MyType

MyType m{2, 3, 5, 7};

<p>Finally, brace initialization can also call ordinary
constructors of data types, even if they do not have

<p>C++11 was the official standard until august 2014, and
is supported by most C++ compilers. It standardizes
some common C++ extensions that we use already, allows
shorthands for some operations, and has some performance
and safety improvements.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>The C++11 standard is substantially more complex than
its predecessor (1,300 pages versus 800 pages), and is
unfamiliar to many developers. The long-term effects of
some features on code readability and maintenance are
unknown. We cannot predict when its various features will
be implemented uniformly by tools that may be of
interest, particularly in the case of projects that are
forced to use older versions of tools.</p>

<p>As with <a href="#Boost">Boost</a>, some C++11
extensions encourage coding practices that hamper
readability&#8212;for example by removing
checked redundancy (such as type names) that may be
helpful to readers, or by encouraging template
metaprogramming. Other extensions duplicate functionality
available through existing mechanisms, which may lead to confusion
and conversion costs.</p>


</div>

<div class="decision">

<p>C++11 features may be used unless specified otherwise.
In addition to what's described in the rest of the style
guide, the following C++11 features may not be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functions (other than lambda functions)
  with trailing return types, e.g. writing
  <code>auto foo() -&gt; int;</code> instead of <code>int
  foo();</code>, because of a desire to preserve
  stylistic consistency with the many existing function
  declarations.</li>

  

  

  

  

  

  <li>Compile-time rational numbers
  (<code>&lt;ratio&gt;</code>), because of concerns that
  it's tied to a more template-heavy interface
  style.</li>

  <li>The <code>&lt;cfenv&gt;</code> and
  <code>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</code> headers, because many
  compilers do not support those features reliably.</li>

  

  <li>Default lambda captures.</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div> 

<h2 id="Naming">Naming</h2>

<p>The most important consistency rules are those that govern
naming. The style of a name immediately informs us what sort of
thing the named entity is: a type, a variable, a function, a
constant, a macro, etc., without requiring us to search for the
declaration of that entity. The pattern-matching engine in our
brains relies a great deal on these naming rules.
</p>

<p>Naming rules are pretty arbitrary, but
 we feel that
consistency is more important than individual preferences in this
area, so regardless of whether you find them sensible or not,
the rules are the rules.</p>

<h3 id="General_Naming_Rules">General Naming Rules</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Function names, variable names, and filenames should be
descriptive; eschew abbreviation.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">
<p>Give as descriptive a name as possible, within reason.
Do not worry about saving horizontal space as it is far
more important to make your code immediately
understandable by a new reader. Do not use abbreviations except acronyms.</p>

<pre>
int price_count_reader;         // No abbreviation.
int dns_connections_number;     // Most people know what "DNS" stands for.
</pre>

<pre class="badcode">
int n;                     // Meaningless.
int nerr;                  // Ambiguous abbreviation.
int num_errors;            // Although "num" is widely used convention, reader should care about
                           // which abbreviation is used this time: num, n, numb?
                           // There is no such problem when only full names are used.
int n_comp_conns;          // Ambiguous abbreviation.
int wgc_connections;       // Only your group knows what this stands for.

<h3 id="File_Names">File Names</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>File names should be all lowercase and can include
underscores (<code>_</code>). The only place where dash (<code>-</code>)

  <li><code class="badcode">my-useful-class.cpp</code></li>
  <li><code class="badcode">my_usefulclass.h</code></li>

<p>C++ files should end in <code>.cpp</code> and header files should end in
<code>.h</code>. Files containing template definitions
should end in <code>-inl.h</code> (see also the section on
<a href="#Definition_and_Declaration">definition and declaration</a>).</p>

<p>In general, make your filenames very specific. For
example, use <code>http_server_logs.h</code> rather than
<code>logs.h</code>. A very common case is to have a pair

(also see <a href="#Non-ASCII_Characters">Non-ASCII Characters</a>).</p>

<div class="stylebody">

<p class="exception">When you pass in a null pointer, boolean, or literal

<p>Coding style and formatting are pretty arbitrary, but a

project is much easier to follow
if everyone uses the same style. Individuals may not agree with every

project contributors follow the
style rules so that 
they can all read and understand
everyone's code easily.</p>

   <li>Pointer operators have no space after the

<p>Note that when the code wraps in this example, both of
the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> logical AND operators are at
the end of the line. This is more common in our code,
though wrapping all operators at the beginning of the
line is also allowed. Feel free to insert extra
parentheses judiciously because they can be very helpful
in increasing readability when used
appropriately. Also note that you should always use
the punctuation operators, such as

the word operators, such as <code>and</code> and

<p>Be careful when using a braced initialization list <code>{...}</code>
on a type with an <code>std::initializer_list</code> constructor.
A nonempty <i>braced-init-list</i> prefers the
<code>std::initializer_list</code> constructor whenever
possible. Note that empty braces <code>{}</code> are special, and
will call a default constructor if available. To force the
non-<code>std::initializer_list</code> constructor, use parentheses
instead of braces.</p>

<pre>vector&lt;int&gt; v(100, 1);  // A vector of 100 1s.
vector&lt;int&gt; v{100, 1};  // A vector of 100, 1.

<p>Also, the brace form prevents narrowing of integral
types. This can prevent some types of programming

int x[] = { 0 };

Foo::Foo(int b)
    : Bar()  // No spaces inside empty braces.
    , baz_(b)
{}           // No spaces inside empty braces.
</pre>

<p>Adding trailing whitespace can cause extra work for
others editing the same file, when they merge, as can
removing existing trailing whitespace. So: Don't
introduce trailing whitespace. Remove it if you're
already changing that line, or do it in a separate
clean-up operation (preferably when no-one
else is working on the file).</p>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Loops and Conditionals</h4>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>If you find yourself modifying code that was written
to specifications other than those presented by this
guide, you may have to diverge from these rules in order
to stay consistent with the local conventions in that
code. If you are in doubt about how to do this, ask the
original author or the person currently responsible for
the code. Remember that <em>consistency</em> includes
local consistency, too.</p>

</div> 
</div> 

<h2 class="ignoreLink">Parting Words</h2>

<p>Use common sense and <em>BE CONSISTENT</em>.</p>

<p>If you are editing code, take a few minutes to look at the
code around you and determine its style. If they use spaces
around their <code>if</code> clauses, you should, too. If their
comments have little boxes of stars around them, make your
comments have little boxes of stars around them too.</p>

<p>The point of having style guidelines is to have a common
vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you are
saying, rather than on how you are saying it. We present global
style rules here so people know the vocabulary. But local style
is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically
different from the existing code around it, the discontinuity
throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Try
to avoid this.</p>



<p>OK, enough writing about writing code; the code itself is much
more interesting. Have fun!</p>
